# Intro to Observability: Demo in Node.js

This Node.js application is here for you to try out tracing.
It consists of a microservice that calls itself, so you can simulate a whole microservice ecosystem with just one service!

Spoiler: this microservice implements the <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Fibonacci_number">Fibonacci sequence</a>.

## What to Do

Recommended:

[![Open in Gitpod](https://gitpod.io/button/open-in-gitpod.svg)](https://gitpod.io/#https://github.com/honeycombio/intro-to-o11y-nodejs)

Alternative:
If you like Glitch, you can [remix this app in Glitch](https://glitch.com/edit/#!/intro-to-o11y-nodejs?path=README.md%3A1%3A0).

Alternative: You can also [run locally](#running-locally)).

### Start the App

`./run`

### See the App

Hit the app at http://localhost:3000

Activate the sequence of numbers by pushing **Go**. After you see numbers, push **Stop**. Try this a few times.

Maybe open the browser tools and notice how long each request takes.
Why does it get slower and slower?

Let's add tracing and find out!

### Stop the App

Push `Ctrl-C` in the terminal where the app is running.

### Configure tracing to connect to Honeycomb

This project has the tracing configuration set up in tracing.js.
See that the top line of `index.js` calls into `tracing.js` to activate this.

In `tracing.js`, the code refers to some environment variables.

Get a Honeycomb API Key from your Team Settings in [Honeycomb](https://ui.honeycomb.io).
(Find this by clicking on your profile in the lower-left corner.)

Recommended:
Copy the example environment:

`cp .env.example .env`

Now edit the contents of `.env` to put in your API key.
This file is ignored by git, so you won't accidentally commit your API key.

The properties in `.env` are read in when the program starts up.

Alternative: set using command line

```bash
export HONEYCOMB_API_KEY=replace-this-with-a-real-api-key
export HONEYCOMB_DATASET=hello-observability # can be any name
export SERVICE_NAME=fib-microsrv # can be any name
```

Remember, get a Honeycomb API Key from your Team Settings in [Honeycomb](https://ui.honeycomb.io). (Find this by clicking on your profile in the lower-left corner.)

You can name the Honeycomb Dataset anything you want.

You can choose any Service Name you want.

Stop the app, start it again, and click Go and Stop.

Head over to [Honeycomb](https://ui.honeycomb.io) for your data.

Do you see some lines?

Scroll down for Recent Traces. Click into one of those. Do you see some spans?

### Part 3 of the workshop: Add a custom field

Let's make it easier to find that 'index' query parameter.

When we receive the request to `/fib`, we know that index is interesting data, so add a field.

To get access to the current span, first import the OpenTelemetry API at the top of `index.js` (this should be there already):

`const otel = require("@opentelemetry/api");`

Then, anywhere in that file, you can grab the current span and add attributes.
Find these lines commented out in the request handler, and uncomment them:

```js
const span = otel.trace.getSpan(otel.context.active());
span.setAttribute("parameter.index", index);
```

Test the app again, look at the traces, and find the new field you added.

### Advanced: Add a Custom Span

How long does the real calculation take?

At the beginning of the `calculateFibonacciNumber` function, create a custom span (or find this line and uncomment it):

`let span = tracer.startSpan("calculation");`

and then after the very exciting calculation, end it:

`span.end();`

Now see if you can spot the portion of your traces used for the real math!

## Running Locally

Clone this repository.

If you use [VSCode devcontainers](https://code.visualstudio.com/docs/remote/containers-tutorial), open the directory in VSCode and choose "Reopen in container" when it offers, or run the "Reopen in container" command.

Otherwise, you'll need Node.js 14+ and npm installed.

Either way, get to a shell prompt and:

```sh
npm install
npm run start
```

Then hit the application locally: http://localhost:3000
